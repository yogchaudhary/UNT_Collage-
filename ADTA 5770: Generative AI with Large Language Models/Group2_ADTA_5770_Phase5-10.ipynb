Add a separate Medicare drug plan\n","(Part D), sometimes called a Prescription Drug Plan (PDP), to Original Medicare (Part A and Part B). These can also be\n","added to some Medicare Cost Plans, Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) Plans, and Medical Savings Account (MSA) Plans. 2.\n","Enroll in a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) or another Medicare health plan that includes prescription drug\n","coverage (MA-PD). Usually, if you join a Medicare Advantage Plan without drug coverage, you cannot add a separate Part D\n","plan.  **What Drugs Are Covered:** *   Each plan has a list of covered drugs called a \"formulary.\" While plans must\n","cover a wide range of drugs, specific drugs covered can vary between plans. *   Formularies must include at least two\n","drugs in the most commonly prescribed categories and classes. *   Most drugs in certain \"protected classes\" must be\n","included: cancer drugs, HIV/AIDS drugs, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and immunosuppressants for\n","organ transplants. *   A Part D drug generally must be: available only by prescription, FDA-approved, used and sold in\n","the U.S., and used for a medically accepted indication (FDA-approved uses or off-label uses supported by specific\n","recognized compendia like Micromedex or AHFS-DI). *   Part D covers all commercially available vaccines when medically\n","necessary to prevent illness (e.g., shingles, RSV, tetanus). *   It also covers insulin and medical supplies associated\n","with insulin (like syringes, needles, alcohol swabs, gauze) that are not covered under Part A or B.  **What Drugs Are\n","Not Covered by Part D:** *   Drugs for which payment is available under Part A or Part B (e.g., injections in a doctor's\n","office, certain oral cancer drugs, drugs used with durable medical equipment like nebulizers, certain drugs in a\n","hospital outpatient setting). *   Drugs or classes of drugs excluded from coverage under Medicare (except for smoking-\n","cessation products).  **Cost Structure (Phases in 2024 Example):** 1.  **Yearly Deductible:** The amount paid out-of-\n","pocket before the plan starts paying. This varies by plan but cannot exceed $545 in 2024. Some plans have no deductible.\n","2.  **Copayment or Coinsurance:** After meeting the deductible, the beneficiary pays a share (copay or coinsurance) for\n","each covered drug, and the plan pays its share until their combined spending reaches a certain limit ($5,030 in the 2024\n","example). 3.  **Coverage Gap:** After reaching the initial coverage limit, the beneficiary enters the coverage gap and\n","pays a copayment for covered drugs. 4.  **Catastrophic Coverage:** After the beneficiary's out-of-pocket costs reach a\n","certain amount ($8,000 in 2024), they enter the catastrophic coverage phase and pay nothing for covered Part D drugs for\n","the rest of the year.  **Coverage Rules:** Plans may use rules like prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity\n","limits to ensure drugs are used correctly and only when medically necessary.  **Other Considerations:** *   A late\n","enrollment penalty may apply if enrollment is delayed. *   Individuals with higher incomes may pay an extra amount in\n","addition to their plan premium. This extra amount must be paid to maintain coverage.\n","................................................................................\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#----------- ADTA 57770: SEMESTER PROJECT: PHASE 10: UN-DEPLOY INDEXES AND DELETE ALL INDEXES & ENDPOINTS\n","\n","\n","# IMPORTANT NOTES:\n","# THE CODE IN THIS FILE IS ONLY USED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS\n","# --) The code of all phases of the semester project is included in ONLY ONE Jupyter Notebook document\n","# --) In other words, the developer complete all phases (1 - 10) in one notebook.\n","\n","# IMPORTANT NOTES:\n","# --) The develop have completed coding PHASE 1, 2, and 3 and run the code correctly before starting the code in this file\n","\n","\n","#---- PHASE 10: STEP 1: Verify the list of currently existing end points\n","\n","# Get the list of end points that have been created\n","\n","list_end_points = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint.list()\n","\n","print(f\"List of indexes: {list_end_points}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"xNPw4pxopj-Z","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745203848309,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":687,"user":{"displayName":"Murali KK","userId":"10665589818856647690"}},"outputId":"ffec6ce9-dc45-498b-8109-bd7aef4e1207"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["List of indexes: [<google.cloud.aiplatform.matching_engine.matching_engine_index_endpoint.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint object at 0x7c02eff84510> \n","resource name: projects/882765483129/locations/us-central1/indexEndpoints/3233580134405505024]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#---- PHASE 10: STEP 2: Look for and take notes of numeric end point IDs\n","# Look for the string of text starting with \"resource name\"\n","# Look for a number (long sequence of digits) at the end of the string of text starting with \"resource name\"\n","# Copy or take note that number: It is the numeric ID of an end point.\n","# Copy or take note that number: It is the numeric ID of all end points displayed in the results of listing\n","\n","# ...\n","\n","#---- PHASE 10: STEP 3: UNDEPLOYED indexes and DELETE ALL end points\n","\n","# GET end points\n","#del_index_endpoint_1 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint(\"a numeric ID of some end point\")\n","#del_index_endpoint_2 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint(\"a numeric ID of some end point\")\n","#del_index_endpoint_3 = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint(\"a numeric ID of some end point\")\n","# ...
